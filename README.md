Independent Study Recipe Organizer

This was a project done for my Independent Study course. I attempted to make a recipe organizer. I used Flask and Jinja to host a local webpage to display this. I used sqlite to store the recipes, users, and meal plans. It is not visually impressive; it's main purpose was for learning, and its main goal was to function. 

If you wish to view the webpage, run server.py and then connect to localhost:5000 in a browser.
